# starter-pete-thinkful-portfolio

This  repo is intended for CSS practice.

Originally the website's content was cascading style was plaing top to bottom.

Flexbox was used to orient the picture of pete from on top of the about me section to placed on the left side.

Flexbox was also used on the portfolio aswell

Inline css was used to change the portfolio art descriptions to 14px

Inline css was also used to center the copyright footer bcuz placing in a div was not giving me the desired outcome.
